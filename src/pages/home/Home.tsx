healthy in the digital world.</Text>
<Text lineHeight='2.5rem' mb='1rem'>
I felt like I was constantly struggling to keep up with the fast-paced world of social
media.</Text>
<Text lineHeight='2.5rem' mb='1rem'>My kids seemed to know more about Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube than I did.
</Text> 
<Text lineHeight='2.5rem' mb='1rem'>And I tried everything I could think of to protect my kids from the dangers of
social media. I set strict limits on screen time, monitored their online activity, and I
talked to them about the importance of staying safe online.</Text>
<Text lineHeight='2.5rem' mb='1rem'>But nothing seemed to work.</Text>
<Text lineHeight='2.5rem' mb='1rem'>
That was when I realized I needed a different approach. I needed to learn how to
navigate the digital world with my kids, rather than trying to fight against it.
</Text>
<Text lineHeight='2.5rem' mb='1rem'>
So, I set out on a journey to discover the secrets of digital parenting. That was
when I attended a webinar on <b>How to Raise Responsible and Resilient Kids in
the age of Social Media.</b></Text>

<Text lineHeight='2.5rem' mb='1rem'>Beyond everything I learnt, the concept of digital footprint was it for me.</Text>

<Text lineHeight='2.5rem' mb='1rem'>Today, my fear and anxiety about my child’s safety online are gone. And I can
confidently say that I am now a digital parent, raising responsible digital citizens."

child is exposed to inappropriate content online and you don’t know how to help
him or her out?</Text>

Do you mind if I show you how to overcome these your worry, fears, and anxiety

<Heading as='h6'  mt=' 4rem' mb='2rem' color="#0f2f3c" >Who am I for you to attend my webinar?</Heading>
<Text>My name is <b>Phil Ikponmwosa.</b></Text>

<Text lineHeight='2.5rem' mb='1rem'>
	I am a parenting expert, Teen’s coach, and a Marketing Communication
professional. Also, I am a father of 3 children (2 Gen. z &amp;1 Gen. Alpha).</Text>

<Text lineHeight='2.5rem' mb='1rem'>
	<Text lineHeight='2.5rem' mb='1rem'>
	I have been working with young people (Gen. Z) for over 2 decades, counseling,
mentoring, and guiding them to live a purposeful and responsible life.</Text>

<Text lineHeight='2.5rem' mb='1rem'></Text>
Above all, I am extremely passionate about creating simple solutions to complex
parenting problems, especially with issues most parents have with their teenagers.</Text>

{/* <Text lineHeight='2.5rem' mb='1rem'>As you quite know, most of us, parents often have misunderstanding with our kids
when they become teenagers and that has made a lot of teenagers to run away from
home, joining bad gangs and wrong association.
</Text>

<Text lineHeight='2.5rem' mb='1rem'>And one of the core challenges that parents often have with their kids in this digital
age is in the area of managing their screen time and activities on the social media.</Text>
<Text lineHeight='2.5rem' mb='1rem'> However, as a Teen’s coach who understands teen’s culture, I have been able to
successfully mediate to bring harmony between parents and their wards in this
area. I have done that through a one-on-one session with both the parents and the
teenagers respectfully.</Text> */}
<Text lineHeight='2.5rem' mb='1rem'>
In addition, I have gone ahead to write and publish different titles that proffer
valid, relatable, and practical solutions to the challenges of parenting, especially in
this digital age. My latest title, <b>Digital Parenting</b> is selling massively on Selar.co
with numerous 5 star rating/reviews.</Text>

<Heading  mt='3rem' mb='2rem'>Here are some of the topics that will be treated at the webinar:</Heading>

Beyond that, with the understanding that a lot of busy parents like you may not
have time to sit and read books, no matter how scanty the volume of the book is, I
decided to be hosting this special parenting webinar, <b>How to Raise Responsible
and Resilient Kids in the age of Social Media.</b>
</Text>
<Text lineHeight='2.5rem' mb='1rem'>
And the testimonials from the different participants who have attended the
previous editions have been simply phenomenal!</Text>
<Text lineHeight='2.5rem' mb='1rem'>
The story you read at the beginning of this write-up is just one of them.
</Text>
<Text lineHeight='2.5rem' mb='1rem'>I am glad to let you know that this edition is the <b>3<sup>rd</sup> edition of this special
parenting webinar</b> and I don’t want you to miss the opportunity of transiting from
an anxious and worried parent raising Generation Z to an informed digital parent
who is able to help and guide their kids on how to navigate the digital world safely
and responsibly.</Text>



{/* 
<Text lineHeight='2.5rem' mb='1rem'>I am sure you might be wondering that if a webinar is that cheap, it simply means
it will be of little or no value.</Text> <Text lineHeight='2.5rem' mb='1rem'>Yes, I have heard that from one of the
participants in my previous editions. I am sure others had the same reservation
while registering for my training, but didn’t voice it out to me. </Text>
<Text lineHeight='2.5rem' mb='1rem'>
She had registered for other webinars with high investment fee but didn’t get
commensurate value for her money.</Text>
<Text lineHeight='2.5rem' mb='1rem'>
However, she decided to just register for my webinar with the mindset that even if
she didn’t get value for money, she won’t be bothered knowing that the amount is
just a token compared to other webinars she had registered for before then.</Text>
<Text lineHeight='2.5rem' mb='1rem'>
But to her amazement, she was wowed by the depth of value that she received
from the training she paid a token fee for. Beyond the class, she still got further

guide after the training.</Text>
<Text lineHeight='2.5rem' mb='1rem'> She concluded that it was wrong to judge the value of a
training by the cost.</Text>
<Text lineHeight='2.5rem' mb='1rem'>
So, if you know that N1,500 cannot be compared with the amount you will pay for
rehabilitating your child if you lose him or her to social media predators and
vampires that are waiting to prey on them, then <Link to='https://selar.co/3wfg'><span style={{fontWeight:'bolder', color: '#9ACD32', fontSize:'2rem'}}>sign up for the course now.</span></Link></Text>
